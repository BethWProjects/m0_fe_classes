# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I feel good about the basic class lesson I learned this morning.  What I'm struggling with the most is how to take all of the pieces and put them together.  If I could figure out how they can fit together, like a puzzle, then I think I will really start to feel more confident.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I tried more collaboration with colleagues today.  I've gained a lot out of these but I also feel like it can take energy away and leave me feeling a little drained for independent work.  So I think finding a good balance between the two will be helpful.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to practice more of the technical content and continue memorizing vocabulary.  I'm a visual learner, so it really helps me to see examples of the code and how to put the pieces together.
